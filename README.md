# Python

## What is Python?

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

## Why Learn Python ?

According to GitHub [Octoverse](https://octoverse.github.com) Python is the second most popular programming language with more than 1M pull requests opened on 2017 and for the IEEE [Spectrum Rank](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2017-top-programming-languages) python has became the most popular programming language in the 2017 displacing languages like C or Java, also, Python has a lot of packages and libraries for all uses like data science, game programming, web development, astronomy, AI. The names of these libraries and references are listed [here](https://github.com/totovr/Python/blob/master/LIBRARIES_LIST.md).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* Last stable version of Python
* Anaconda
* A computer with OSX, Windows, Linux

### Installing

* Install the last stable version of Python, in this case I will install Python 3.3.6, you can download it from this page [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

* Install Anaconda from the official page (for Python 3.6) [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos)

## Check installation:

1.- Open a terminal

2.- type:

    python --version

4.- If you got the next result the installation of Python 3 is complete:

5.- Check this link to know how to use [Anaconda](https://github.com/totovr/Python/tree/Anaconda)

## Run simple code:

You can find [here](https://github.com/totovr/Python/tree/Anaconda/Basic) a simple example

## More examples

This [branch](https://github.com/totovr/Python/tree/Jupyter) a simple example has programs in Jupyter 

## Also you can use the next editors to build programs:

* [Atom](https://atom.io/) and the package [Hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen)
* [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
