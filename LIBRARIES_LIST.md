# Most Common Python Libraries

* **NumPy:** Made for scientific computations, included with Anaconda, provides an abundance of useful features for operations on n-arrays and matrices in Python, it also provides vectorization of mathematical operations on the NumPy array type, which improves performance and speeds up the execution of the script.

* **SciPy:** For engineering and science, has built-in functions for numerical integration, optimization of algorithms, it uses a lot of NumPy arrays.

* **Pandas:** Used to work with larges amounts of data in a simple and intuitive manner. These 3 libraries are the basic stack for a data scientist.

* **Matplotlib:** For data visualization it has a lot of plot functions like line and scatter plots, bar charts, histograms.

* **Seaborn:** Mostly used in visualization of statistical models, based in Matplotlib and higly dependent on that.

* **SciKit-Learn:** Includes functions for machine learning, and image processing

* **NLTK:** The name stands for Natural Language Toolkit, and is used for Linguistics, and Cognitive Science Artificial Intelligencce.

* **Django:** High level web framework, fast, secure, and scalable, webapps like Instagram, Pinterest or Quora are built using Django.

* **Astropy:** Software packages designed for astronomy and astrophysics.

* **Pygame:** Set of Python modules oriented to 2D game programming but you con also use for creating GUI's (Graphic User Interfaces), or multimedia software.

* **Pillow:** Python Imaging Library for image processing (convert images, cutting and merging images, geometrical transformations, color transformations, etc).

* **OpenCV:** Open Source Computer Vision Library, supports C, C++, Java and Python for PC, Android or iOS applications, you can check some examples [here](https://github.com/totovr/OpenCV).
