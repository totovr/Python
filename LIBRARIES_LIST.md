# Most Common Python Libraries

* **NumPy:** Made for scientific computations, included with Anaconda, provides an abundance of useful features for operations on n-arrays and matrices in Python, it also provides vectorization of mathematical operations on the NumPy array type, which improves performance and speeds up the execution of the script.

* **SciPy:** For engineering and science, has built-in functions for numerical integration, optimization of algorithms, it uses a lot of NumPy arrays.

* **Pandas:** Used to work with larges amounts of data in a simple and intuitive manner. These 3 libraries are the basic stack for a data scientist.

* **Matplotlib:** For data visualization it has a lot of plot functions like line and scatter plots, bar charts, histograms.

* **Seaborn:** Mostly used in visualization of statistical models, based in Matplotlib and higly dependent on that.

* **SciKit-Learn:** Includes functions for machine learning, and image processing

* **NLTK:** The name stands for Natural Language Toolkit, and is used for Linguistics, and Cognitive Science Artificial Intelligencce.

* **Django:** High level web framework, fast, secure, and scalable, webapps like Instagram, Pinterest or Quora are built using Django.
